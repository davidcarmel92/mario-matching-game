How to Play the Game

The game board is made up of 8 pairs of mario characters. The cards are randomly shuffled at the start of each game.

On each turn:

The user clicks on a card to reveal the character on the backside.
The user turns over a second card to reveal a second character.
If the cards match, the carsd stay open.
If the cards do not match, the characters will be hidden again.
The game is over when all matches have been found.

Special Features

The game has a clock that begins once the first card is turned over. Once you finis the game, your final completion time will be shown.
At the start of the game, a star-rating will be shown in the upper-left hand corner. Intially there will be three stars, 
but the number of stars will decrease as more moves are made. 
When the game ends, the final time, final star rating, number of moves made, and a restart button will be displayed in a pop-up.
